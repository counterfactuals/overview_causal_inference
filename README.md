# A Brief Overview of Causal Inference

This repository contains all of the source material for my presentation on a brief overview of causal infererence. The presentation covers the
basics of causal inference from observational data, model evaluation, causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning.

I created the presentation in R studio using the `xaringan` package.

This is a work in progress that I am using to teach myself the basics of causal infererence. I am also using it to give an overview to ML
colleagues who have not been exposted to causal infererence.
